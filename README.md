This repository contains "Torchbearer," my inaugural major project in Adobe Photoshop, created as a focused study in advanced digital compositing and dynamic lighting techniques.

## 🌟 Project Goal

The primary goal was to create a dramatic, atmospheric scene that successfully integrates multiple independent elements (a figure, a large bird, and a rock face) using a single, intense light source (the torch). This challenged me to achieve realism and scale in a dark, misty environment.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

The project was executed with an emphasis on non-destructive editing and precise control over every element. The source PSD showcases the application of the following core techniques:

* **Layer Management:** Utilizing well-organized **Layers** for file structure and maintaining editability.
* **Targeted Adjustments:** Extensive use of **Clipping Masks** to apply effects and lighting exclusively to underlying layers (e.g., ensuring the torch glow only affects the rock and bird wings).
* **Non-Destructive Color/Light Control:** Employing **Hue/Saturation** and **Color Overlay** Adjustment Layers to harmonize the color palette and introduce the warm light gradient from the torch.
* **Precise Selection:** Utilizing **Object Selection Tools** for accurate and clean extraction of the composite elements from their original backgrounds.
